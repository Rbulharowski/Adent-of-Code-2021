# Adent-of-Code-2021

My attempts and completed code for 2021 Advent of code.

This contains my completed code. It also contains my datasets which i save as text documents

Days 1-14,16,17,20,21, 22 Part 1, 25 Part 1 have been my own ideas on how to tackle each problem.

Day 15 and 23: I needed a hint on which theory I had to recreate to make the code work.

Day 24: Needed help from Eric Burden's data analysis explaination to help me develop code to solve it.
